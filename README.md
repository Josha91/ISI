# Intergenerational Solidarity Index

All relevant data should be in the top level folder including the two published papers. The methods in these are now, however, outdated. The other files are for creating graphs and figures currently hosted on the [Good Ancestor](https://romankrznaric.com/good-ancestor/intergenerational-solidarity-index) website.

If you notice something weird, you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/pipari/ISI/issues).

The [changelog](https://github.com/pipari/ISI/blob/master/changelog.md) summarises updates to the current version.
