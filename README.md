All data for the index should be in the [/Index2019](https://github.com/pipari/ISI/tree/master/Index2019) folder. Journal Articles are in the journal articles folder.

The other files are for creating graphs and figures currently hosted on the [Good Ancestor](https://romankrznaric.com/good-ancestor/intergenerational-solidarity-index) website.
